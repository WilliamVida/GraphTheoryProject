# Overview

## Introduction
This purpose of this repository is to build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text. The repository contains "shunting.py" which is the shunting-yard algorithm. "thompsons.py" is Thompson's construction. "regextonfa.py" is where the user can compare a regular expression to a string.

## Run
To download Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download Python for your respective operating system and after you through the installation setup, download the repository and use the following command:
``` python regextonfa.py ```

## Test
The tests are done in the "tests.py" using "unittest", which a unit testing framework.
